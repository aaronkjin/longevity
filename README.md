# Longevity

A platform that recommends lifestyle practices to advance your longevity, powered by GPT model and trained on custom-made ontology.

## Getting Started

```bash
# go into each directory, backend or frontend, for more details.
```

## Design

### Backend

The backend leverages OpenAI embeddings and GPT-4, trained with our custom ontology, to generate personalized recommendations based on the user's given genetic, social, and environmental factors based on our custom ontology.

### Frontend

The frontend displays an intuitive, sleek UI, facilitating the input of user responses and displaying these personalized recommendations.

### Ontology

The ontology houses our custom graph to model and display the intricate relationships between the genetic, social, and environmental factors that determine and influence one's aging and longevity.

## Technologies Used

### Backend

- Python
- OpenAI API
- Transformers
- PyTorch
- RDFLib
- Sklearn

Where OpenAI API is used to generate AI-powered recommendations, Transformers is an NLP library for text embeddings and model interactions, PyTorch is an ML library for Transformers models, RDFLib is a library for working with RDF data, and Sklearn is used for calculating cosine similarity between vectors.

### Frontend

- TypeScript
- HTML/CSS
