# Longevity Backend

The backend leverages OpenAI embeddings and GPT-4, trained with our custom ontology, to generate personalized recommendations based on the user's given genetic, social, and environmental factors based on our custom ontology.

## Getting Started

```bash
# ensure Python is installed in system, download if not
python --version

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run script
python longevity.py
```

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenAI API
- Transformers
- PyTorch
- RDFLib
- Sklearn

Where OpenAI API is used to generate AI-powered recommendations, Transformers is an NLP library for text embeddings and model interactions, PyTorch is an ML library for Transformers models, RDFLib is a library for working with RDF data, and Sklearn is used for calculating cosine similarity between vectors.
